A heart disease prediction project using machine learning involves leveraging algorithms to analyze medical data and predict the likelihood of an individual developing heart disease. Key steps include data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Commonly used algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. The project aims to enhance early detection and preventive measures by utilizing patterns and correlations within the data to make accurate predictions about a person's cardiovascular health.
